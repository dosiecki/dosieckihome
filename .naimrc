# naim configuration file.
# This file was automatically generated by using the /save command from within
# naim. Feel free to modify it with any text editor.
# 
# Lines beginning with a # are ignored by naim, so I will use those to document
# each line I write out. In most cases I will attempt to skip over writing out
# redundant information, such as when your settings matched the defaults, but
# in situations where I do include such information I will also place a # in
# front, to show you what the default value is without actually setting it.
# 
# The structure of this file is fairly simple: Lines that start with a # are
# ignored, lines that don't are treated as if you had typed them when first
# starting naim (so anything that can go after a forward slash while running
# naim is fair game for inclusion here).
# 
# If you have any questions about this file, or naim in general, feel free to
